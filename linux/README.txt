Workcraft is a cross-platform toolset to capture, simulate, synthesize and
verify graph models. It supports a wide range of popular graph formalisms
and provides a plugin-based framework to model and analyze new model types.

To start Workcraft execute the 'workcraft' shell script -- it sets the
path to JVM and the classpath for Workcraft plugins.
